Creates and Edits Custom Holdings Paths and Groups

Custom Holdings allow you to prioritize potential lenders by setting up groups of lender symbols and setting up holdings paths that determine which groups of lender symbols display in which order when results are returned by OCLC Searching. 

A custom holdings path is a record that contains the names of holdings groups appropriate to a set of requests. Within the holdings path record are listed holdings group records in order of borrowing preference.

A custom holdings group is a record that contains the OCLC symbols of preferred lenders for a particular category of borrowing activities.
